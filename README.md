##### Sprint 5 and 6

###### Sprint goal 

The goal of this sprint was to Finish all Remaining Features That I Could implement and make sure the project is functioning with minimal bugs 

###### sprint review and retrospective

I was not able to add all the features that I wanted to. mainly a login page, as that would have allowed me to expand the app even more by adding in Admin functionality, so they can moderate User and Manga tables.

## Overall Project retrospective

During this process I have learned that I must really define my goal for each sprint clearly. During each sprint I didn't put enough value in clearly labelling what I would be working on on that day. This would lead me to  working inefficiently and  having a lack of a concrete direction. The main highlight of this project for me was showing how a base understanding is very important. Not all my Knowledge was up to par so I found that I would get stuck very often, this would lead to delayed sprint goals and me not following the Scrum methodology very well. I've gained a lot of confidence during this and I'm confident that I will deliver an even better product in the future.  I will also Utilise a TDD mindset even more.
